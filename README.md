## Preamble

Ysmir's Beard is a Skyrim modlist available on Wabbajack. I've been enjoying Wabbajack modlists for years, and wanted to finally make my contribution back to this wonderful game and the modding community. I hope you enjoy it. 

### What kind of list is it?

Ysmir's Beard aims to modernize Skyrim's graphics and overhaul the game in the way I find most enjoyable to play. Since this is my first attempt at list-building, this will be a lot lighter than some of the 3,000 or 4,000 count modlists you might be used to playing. My goal is for it to look amazing, play like enhanced vanilla, and not be bloated with every mod under the sun. It will be harder than vanilla, but not as hard as Requiem, and I try to give you a lot of freedom on how you like your progression to unfold. I also empahsize lore-friendliness and immersion wherever possible. 

There are not a ton of quest and content overhauls in this list; mainly because they tend to have a lot of conflicts, and more importantly I feel they tend to fall short in some way---either the writing, the voice-acting, the level design, etc. I have included a few I find worthwhile. 

Nudity and jiggle physics are built-in by default, so you never have to worry about removing that hideous underwear. There is, however, no sex or explicit content.

### Highlights:

* Built on NGVO 5.0.

* SimonRim

* Hosts most of JaySerpa's quality-of-life mods.

* Hosts most of JK's city and interior overhauls.

* A few select content additions like Bruma, Midwood Isle, and Bal Meryan.

* 5 new playable races! 

* Tons of unmarked locations to find.

* Better/more interesting loot!!!

* Carefully-selected followers voiced by real people.

* New weapons and armors, including some skimpy (but still relatively lore-friendly) outfits for your viewing pleasure.

* Toggleable options that make your time more fun, such as soundtrack choices, controller support, leveling freedom, lanterns, and more.

### System Requirements

### Disclaimer

Only support English Steam versions of Skyrim Special Edition are supported. GOG and other Languages are not supported.

⚠️ ❗ YSMIR'S BEARD REQUIRES YOUR SKYRIM VERSION TO BE UPDATED TO 1.6.1170 AND THIS IS THE GAME VERSION THAT THE MODLIST RUNS ON. YOU ALSO NEED FULL ANNIVERSARY EDITION ($20 UPGRADE) ❗ ⚠️

Only, Windows 10 and 11 work with Wabbajack fully. LTSC, special variants, lightened editions or any other modified variant WILL NOT WORK. Your windows version must be 21H2 or newer to run both Wabbajack and NGVO.

Running the list from Hard Disk Drives or external drives is STRONGLY ADVISED AGAINST. A lot of content is swapped at game run time and, as a result, fast storage and RAM are needed.

### Recommended System Requirements

Ysmir's Beard requires at least a mid-tier modern system to run to its fullest potential. To have graphics this good requires a lot of mods, and consequently a lot of VRAM.

**I recommend a minimum of 16 GB VRAM to play this game without serious frame drops.**  

I have a 7900 XT 20 GB card, and get 50-120 FPS almost everywhere. I personally use AMD's native frame gen when I play. 

**Minimums:** 

- CPU | 12th Generation i7 or better/equivalent
- Ram | 32GB DDR4 Ram  + 40GB Pagefile 
- Storage | NVME SSD
- GPU | 12 GB VRAM, preferably 16 GB+

**Space required:**

## Install Steps, Start to Finish

You will need:

#### 1. A CLEAN, fresh install of Skyrim.

  - Open Steam and go to your Library

  - Find The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition in the list
  
  - Right-click on it and select Manage -> Uninstall

  - Navigate to Steam\steamapps\common\ and, if present, delete the Skyrim Special Edition folder

  - Navigate to Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition and delete all the files ending in .INI

  - Open Steam and go to your library.

  - Find The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition and select install

  - Select next and wait for the install to finish

  - Run the game through Steam. Wait for the Creation Club popup to appear, then select download. Let them all download, it will take about 5-10 minutes.

  - Close game.

#### 2. A 40 Gb pagefile. See how to setup a page file here: https://www.tomshardware.com/news/how-to-manage-virtual-memory-pagefile-windows-10,36929.html

#### 3. Install Visual C++ x64 & .Net Runtime v5 desktop x64 if you havent already for other lists.

#### 4. Change Skyrim so it does not automatically update (Right click SKyrim in Steam/Properties/Updates/Only Update When I Launch the Game).

#### 5. Fully disable OneDrive and any other programs which hook into user file areas.

#### 6. Install the **Skyrim Special Edition: Creation Kit on Steam** and **run it at least once.** https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946180/Skyrim_Special_Edition_Creation_Kit/

#### 7. Download the latest Wabbajack, install to your main drive. NOT in Program Files. Should be something like C:\Wabbajack.

#### 8. Find Ysmir's Beard, and select download.

#### 9. When prompted, create a file in your main drive (usually C) called C:\YsmirsBeard. Your download folder can be wherever you want, but if you have space, just make it C:\YsmirsBeard\downloads.

#### 10. Click the play button and let Wabbajack do its thing. Depending on your connection speed, it should take 2-4 hours.

#### 11. If you're lucky, you'll get through the whole install with no errors!! But errors can happen. Some common issues are listed below.

  - Could not download x:
Big files can fail to download due to connection issues. You can either run Wabbajack again or download the file manually. If you decide to manually download it, make sure to place it in the same place as the other downloads.
       **Make sure you have downloaded all the AE update content!**
       **Make sure you have the Creation Kit installed. Go back to Step 1 and read it properly this time.**

   - x is not a whitelisted download:
This will happen when I update the modlist. Please check if there is a new update or wait until you see a release ping.

   - Wabbajack could not find my game folder:
Either buy the game or go back to the Pre-Installation step.

   - Antivirus reports a virus:
Disable any 3rd party (non-Windows) antivirus programs. If you have followed it then you can fix this by adding an exclusion for Mod Organizer in Windows Defender.

#### 12. Starting up the list

  - Open the installation folder and double-click on the program called ModOrganizer.exe. Make a desktop shortcut and rename it if you want.

  - Go to the **optionals separator** and select any options you think you might want. Not mandatory, you can always come back to it.

  - Make sure the dropdown box on the right is set to Ysmir's Beard and press the Run button.
    
#### 13. In-game MCM options

  - Once in-game, create your character.

  - Once created, **LET THE MCM RECORDER RUN TO COMPLETION.** Ysmir's Beard needs to setup MCM options to run as intended. Of course, you are free to change whatever you like once this has completed. *Unless you know what you are doing, DONT F*CK with DynDOLOD.*

#### 14. Enjoy the game!!!

## FAQ, Problems, and Tips

- DO NOT mess with the plugin load order (right pane in MO2). This is curated to work. If you add mods, make sure they load BEFORE FWMF plugins. Best practice is to place any added mods just above DynDOLOD/Occlusion. If you get a blue map, you have something loaded after maps.
  
- You are free to add mods, but I cant support any resulting issues. In general, adding armor, weapons, and bodyslide presets is straightforward and not game-breaking.
  
- You can get better (perceived) performance by enabaling Framegen in the ENB menu (shift+enter). Game will need to be restarted for this to take effect. I recommend this over Lossless Scaling.

- You can get better actual performance by installing performance-friendly grass and tree mods (Happy Little Trees and Skoglendi are good options), but this is not supported. NGVO Discord FAQ has some guides. Beware, it is time-consuming and can break your game if you dont know what you're doing.

- The only surefire way to get better performance is to get a better GPU.

- Best practices for saving: Do not Autosave. Manual save only. I personally not not overwrite. When you die, let the game take you back to the main menu and reload your save. This helps prevent save corruption.

- Always best practice to not add mods mid-playthrough. Real world, I do this and so do many others, but you do risk save corruption.

- If you have questions or suggestions for new mods, swing by my Discord.
