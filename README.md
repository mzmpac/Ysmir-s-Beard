This is the GitHub repository for the modlist Ysmir's Beard, by MZMpac. 




## Preamble

Ysmir's Beard is---obviously---a Skyrim modlist available on Wabbajack. I've been enjoying Wabbajack modlists for years, and wanted to finally make my contribution back to this wonderful game and the modding community. I hope you enjoy it. 

#### What kind of list is it?

Ysmir's Beard aims to modernize Skyrim's graphics and overhaul the game in the way I find most enjoyable to play. It's harder than vanilla, but not as hard as Requiem, and tries to empahsize lore-friendliness and immersion wherever possible. 

There are NOT a ton of quest and content overhauls in this list; mainly because I feel they tend to fall short in some way---either the writing, the voice-acting, the level design, etc--- but I have included the ones I find worthwhile to play. 

Nudity and jiggle physics are built-in by default, so you never have to worry about removing that hideous underwear. There is, however, no sex or explicit content, nor will there ever be. This is not pornrim. 

#### Highlights:

* Built on NGVO 5.0.

* Hosts the full SimonRim suite of gameplay mods. 

* Hosts most of JaySerpa's quality-of-life mods.

* Hosts most of JK's city and interior overhauls.

* A few select content additions like Wyrmstooth, Bruma, and Olenveld.

* Two New races to play--Deep Elf and Snow Elf. 

* Tons of unmarked locations to find.

* Better/more interesting loot!!!

* Carefully-selected followers voiced by real people.

* New weapons and armors, including some skimpy (but still relatively lore-friendly) outfits for your viewing pleasure.

* Toggleable options that make your time more fun, such as soundtrack choices, controller support, leveling freedom, lanterns, and more.

## System Requirements

### Disclaimer

Owing to the need to clean master files and certain errors with Wabbajack, NGVO and Ysmir's Beard only support English Steam versions of Skyrim Special Edition. GOG and other Languages are not supported.

⚠️ ❗ YSMIR'S BEARD REQUIRES YOUR SKYRIM VERSION TO BE UPDATED TO 1.6.1170 AND THIS IS THE GAME VERSION THAT THE MODLIST RUNS ON. YOU ALSO NEED FULL ANNIVERSARY EDITION ($20 UPGRADE) ❗ ⚠️

Only, Windows 10 and 11 work with Wabbajack fully. LTSC, special variants, lightened editions or any other modified variant WILL NOT WORK. Your windows version must be 21H2 or newer to run both Wabbajack and NGVO.

Running the list from Hard Disk Drives or external drives is STRONGLY ADVISED AGAINST. A lot of content is swapped at game run time and, as a result, fast storage and RAM are needed.

## Recommended System Requirements

Ysmir's Beard requires at least a mid-tier modern system to run to its fullest potential. To have graphics this good requires a lot of mods, and consequently a lot of VRAM.

#### I recommend a minimum of 12 GB VRAM to play this game. 

That said, I have a 10 GB 3080, and get by with framedrops in demanding areas. YMMV.
